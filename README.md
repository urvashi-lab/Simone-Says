# 🎮 Simone Says

**Simone Says** is a simple and fun browser-based memory game inspired by the classic "Simon Says." The player must recall and repeat an increasingly long sequence of button presses, each linked to a colored button.

## 🌟 Features

- Clean and interactive UI
- Random color sequence generation
- Visual feedback with smooth animations
- Progressive difficulty (each level adds one more step)
- Fully responsive layout using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A button will blink to indicate the beginning of the sequence.
3. Memorize the sequence and click the buttons in the same order.
4. With each level, a new button is added to the sequence.
5. A wrong move will reset the game to level 1.
